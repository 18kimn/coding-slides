    <h1>welcome to the <code>coding-slides</code> backend!</h1>
    <div id="overview">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This is a super simple API for educators. It provides access to a simple
        server resource to run code interactively online. The main intention is
        to be used in slides, as described
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/18kimn/coding-slides"
          >here</a
        >, but it can also be used for teaching APIs, in other web apps besides
        Reveal.js slides, or in general just as an experimental playground for
        running code. Currently supports R, python3, and nodeJS.
      </p>
      <p>
        This API is hosted on a single AWS EC2 instance, which is a virtual machine
        running Ubuntu that simply runs the given code and sends it back to the
        client. This is dangerous sort of by nature, and although I have
        restricted the permissions of the API to be unable to create or destroy
        files, it's possible that the server may be misused. Also, because this
        is running on a single EC2 t2-micro machine, I'm predicting the capacity
        will be fairly low and it will break with any real usage. All of that to
        say, please be courteous and kind, only use this API for your own slides
        and quick demos, and don't run anything intensive or dangerous here. :)

      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <ul>
        Endpoints:
        <li><code>/</code> (the root): this page, an intro to the backend</li>
        <li>
          <code>/src</code> : the main endpoint to run an execute scripts.
          Receives <code>GET</code> requests; returns <code>stdout</code> and
          <code>stderror</code> as strings.
          <ul>
            Query options:
            <li>
              <code>data</code> : A URI-encoded string representing the code to
              run
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>languageEngine</code> : The name of an executable script to
              use to run the code input. Currently the only supported options
              are <code> Rscript, python3, </code> and <code> node</code>.
